# Water Jug Problem Solver and Language Detection

This repository contains two separate programs:

1. Water Jug Problem Solver: A Python program that solves the Water Jug problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

2. Language Detection: A Python program that detects the language of a given text using the langdetect library.

## Water Jug Problem Solver

The Water Jug problem solver program allows you to find a solution for measuring a specific amount of water using two jugs with different capacities. It implements a BFS algorithm to explore all possible states and determine if a solution exists.

### Usage

1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already.

2. Run the `water_jug_problem_solver.py` file.

3. Enter the capacities of the two jugs and the target amount of water when prompted.

4. The program will display the steps to measure the target amount of water, or indicate if it is not possible.

## Language Detection

The Language Detection program allows you to detect the language of a given text using the langdetect library in Python. It utilizes the language detection algorithm to analyze the text and determine the most probable language.

### Usage

1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already.

2. Run the `language_detection.py` file.

3. Enter the text for language detection when prompted.

4. The program will display the detected language of the text.

## Dependencies

The Water Jug problem solver program has no external dependencies.

The Language Detection program requires the `langdetect` library. You can install it by running `pip install langdetect`.
